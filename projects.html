            <h2>Objective:</h2>
            <p>Project Name: Birdy Flap<br>
            Time Duration: 3-week time duration (October 3rd to October 24th, 2025)<br>
            Class: Computer Science Essentials - CSE</p>
            
            <p>The objective of this project was to make a game that is very similar to the popular game of Flappy Bird. My partner, Ismail Khalid, took inspiration from Flappy Bird, as it used to be one of our favorite games when we were younger. Mine and Ismail's roles varied throughout the project. During the 3-week duration, half the class I coded, and the second half of the class, Ismail coded. While one person coded, the other person worked on designing the user interface, as well as working on the planning documentation. I learned many things, both in communication and programming. I learned how to talk with my partners and communicate when we had differences in our opinions. Programming wise, me and my partner had to build all the code from scratch, without a tutorial, which really improved our coding and problem solving skills. We had to overcome many challenges such as the pictures not fitting, code not working, etc. But by using our planning document, we were able to figure everything out, and end up making our app almost exactly like the actual flappy bird.</p>
